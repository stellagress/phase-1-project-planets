# phase-1-project-planets
Project planets is an informational page that shows basic characteristics and curiosities about the planets. The first part will display an ordered list of all the planets starting from the closest planet to sun (Mercury) to the furtherst, Neptune. When you click on a planet name, page scrolls down to display additional information about that planet in an unordered list format such as the selected planet's name, size, predominant color, average temperature, an image, and a curiosity from respective planet available through a button.
